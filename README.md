# Codes for numerical analysis:
The subject is divided into three main topics

## 1. Linear system resolution

There are two main approaches:
### Direct Methods
- LU factorization
- Cholesky factorization
- QR factorization
### Iterative Methods
- Splitting based methods (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR)
- Richardson methods
- GMRES algorithm
 ## 2. Matrix's spectrum research
 ## 3. EDP resolution
